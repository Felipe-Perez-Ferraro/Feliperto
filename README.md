# :fireworks: Felipe Perez Ferraro

**`Front-End Developer`**

Hi! I am Felipe, a future full-stack developer currently improving my skills at Microverse, a remote software development program that uses pair programming and project building to teach software development. I started by doing simple pages with no interactions and these last few months I did a lot of interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
